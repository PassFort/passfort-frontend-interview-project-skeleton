# Passfort Frontend Pair Programming Interview

Your frontend interview will be a pair programming exercise. You will be asked to work with your interviewer to write a React frontend (the requirements will be given to you during the interview).
You should write the code using whatever approach you are comfortable with, but be aware that we expect you to produce production ready code. This means refactoring for readability/maintainability/testability and consideration for edge-cases.

We have included an out-of-the-box Hello World app, which you are welcome to build on in the interview. You are equally welcome to prepare your own skeleton app if you prefer.

The interview task is deliberately a big problem with multiple areas of complexity, and we intentionally do not give you enough time to finish it. We are interested in the quality of the code that you write, how you respond to feedback, and the way in which you reason about problems.
We are not interested in whether you finish the exercise.

Remember that the interviewer is there to help. They may try to guide you towards interesting parts of the problem or scenarios in which your solution might not behave correctly.
